A terminal client for *sonic music servers. Inspired by ncmpcpp and musickube.

## Features

* browse by folder
* queue songs and albums
* create and play playlists
* favorites
* volume control
* server-side scrobbling (e.g. on Navidrome, gonic)
* [MPRIS2](https://mpris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) control

## Screenshots

These are using [Navidrome's demo server](https://demo.navidrome.org/) ([config file](./stmp-navidromedemo.toml)).

## Dependencies

[mpv](https://mpv.io):

* Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `apt install libmpv libmpv-dev`
* MacOS (Homebrew): `brew install mpv` (not the cask)

Go build dependencies

* Go 1.19+
* [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview)
* [go-mpv](https://github.com/yourok/go-mpv/mpv)

### OSX path setup

On OSX if you installed mpv with brew you may need to set the following paths:

```shell
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Compiling

stmp should compile normally with `go build`. Cgo is needed for linking with libmpv.

## Configuration

stmp looks for a config file called `stmp.toml` in either `$HOME/.config/stmp`
or the directory in which the executable is placed.

### Example configuration

```toml
[auth]
username = 'admin'
password = 'password'
plaintext = true  # Use 'legacy' unsalted password auth. (default: false)

[server]
host = 'https://your-subsonic-host.tld'
scrobble = true   # Use Subsonic scrobbling for last.fm/ListenBrainz (default: false)
```

## Usage

* Q - quit
* 1 - folder view
* 2 - queue view
* 3 - playlist view
* 4 - log (errors, etc) view
* Escape/Return - close modal if open

* p - play/pause

quite a bit.
