## Features

- Browse by folder
- Queue songs and albums
- Create and play playlists

## Dependencies

### Required Software

- [mpv](https://mpv.io)
- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `apt install pkg-config libmpv libmpv-dev`
- MacOS (Homebrew): `brew install pkg-config mpv` (not the cask)

### Go Build Dependencies

- Go 1.22+
  - [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview)
  - [go-mpv](https://github.com/supersonic-app/go-mpv) (supersonic's fork)

## Compiling

Compile STMPS with `go build`. Cgo is needed for interfacing with libmpv.

STMPS can be installed without checking out the repository by running:

```bash
  go install github.com/spezifisch/stmps@latest
```

### Developers & Distribution Packagers

There's a Makefile with tasks for:

- Updating the CHANGELOG.md
- Running tests & linting commands
- Compiling an executable with a derived tag for the version

These tasks depend on the following tools:

- [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/) for updating the CHANGELOG.md
- [markdownlint](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) for running the markdown linting test
- [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) for linting the Go code

## Configuration

STMPS looks for a configuration file named `stmp.toml` in either `$HOME/.config/stmp` or the directory containing the executable.

### Example Configuration

```toml
[auth]
username = 'admin'
password = 'password'
plaintext = true  # Use 'legacy' unsalted password authentication (default: false)

[server]
host = 'https://your-subsonic-host.tld'
scrobble = true  # Use Subsonic scrobbling for last.fm/ListenBrainz (default: false)

[client]
random-songs = 50

[ui]
spinner = '▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁'
```

## Usage

### General Navigation

- `Q`: Quit
- `1`: Folder view
- `2`: Queue view
- `3`: Playlist view
- `4`: Search view
- `5`: Log (errors, etc.) view
- `Escape`/`Return`: Close modal if open

### Playback Controls

These controls are accessible from any view:

- `p`: Play/pause
- `P`: Stop
- `>`: Next song
- `-`/`=`: Volume down/volume up
- `,`/`.`: Seek -10/+10 seconds
- `r`: Add 50 random songs to the queue
- `s`: Start a server library scan

### Browser Controls

- `Enter`: Play song (clears current queue)
- `a`: Add album or song to queue
- `y`: Toggle star on song/album
- `A`: Add song to playlist
- `R`: Refresh the list (if in artist directory, only refreshes that artist)
- `/`: Search artists
- `n`: Continue search forward
- `N`: Continue search backward
- `S`: Add similar artist/song/album to playlist

### Queue Controls

- `d`/`Delete`: Remove currently selected song from the queue
- `D`: Remove all songs from queue
- `y`: Toggle star on song
- `k`: Move song up in queue
- `j`: Move song down in queue
- `s`: Save the queue as a playlist
- `S`: Shuffle the songs in the queue
- `l`: Load a queue previously saved to the server

When stmps exits, the queue is automatically recorded to the server, including the position in the song being played. There is a *single* queue per user that can be thusly saved. Because empty queues can not be stored on Subsonic servers, this queue is not automatically loaded; the `l` binding on the queue page will load the previous queue and seek to the last position in the top song.

If the currently playing song is moved, the music is stopped before the move, and must be re-started manually.

The save function includes an autocomplete function; if an existing playlist is selected (or manually entered), the `Overwrite` checkbox **must** be checked, or else the queue will not be saved. If a playlist is saved over, it will be **replaced** with the queue contents.

### Playlist Controls

- `n`: New playlist
- `d`: Delete playlist
- `a`: Add playlist or song to queue

On servers with a large number of songs in the playlists, Subsonic can take a while to respond to a request for a list. stmps therefore loads playlists in the background, and will display a spinner next to the "playlist" tab label at the bottom. This spinner can be configured with the `ui.spinner` option in the config file. Some ideas are:

```toml
spinner = '▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃▁'
spinner = '⠁⠂⠄⡀⢀⠠⠐⠈'
spinner = '|/-\'
spinner = '▖▘'
spinner = '▖▌▘'
spinner = '┤┘┴└├┌┬┐'
spinner = '⣾⣽⣻⢿⡿⣟⣯⣷'
```

The default is `▉▊▋▌▍▎▏▎▍▌▋▊▉`. Set only one of these at a time, and the glyphs must exist in the font that the terminal running stmps is using.

### Search Controls

The search tab performs a server-side search for text in metadata name fields. The search results are filtered into three columns: artist, album, and song, where each entry matches the query in name or title.

In any of the columns:

- `/`: Focus search field.
- `Enter` / `a`: Adds the selected item recursively to the queue.
- Left/right arrow keys (`←`, `→`) navigate between the columns
- Up/down arrow keys (`↓`, `↑`) navigate the selected column list

In the search field:

- `Enter`: Perform the query.
- `Escape`: Escapes into the columns, where the global key bindings work.

Note that the Search page is *not* a browser like the Browser page: it displays the search results returned by the server. Selecting a different artist will not change the album or song search results. OpenSubsonic servers implement the search function differently; in gonic, if you search for "black", you will get artists with "black" in their names in the artists column; albums with "black" in their titles in the albums column; and songs with "black" in their titles in the songs column. Navidrome appears to include all results with "black" anywhere in their IDv3 metadata. Since the API search results filteres these matches into sections -- artists, albums, and songs -- this means that, with Navidrome, you may see albums that don't have "black" in their names; maybe "black" is in their artist title.

## Advanced Configuration and Features

### MPRIS2 Integration

To enable MPRIS2 support (Linux only), run STMPS with the `-mpris` flag. Ensure you have D-Bus set up correctly on your system.

### MacOS Media Control

On MacOS, STMPS integrates with the native MediaPlayer framework to handle system media controls. This is automatically enabled if running on MacOS. *Note:* This is work in progress.

### Profiling

To profile the application, use the following flags:

- `-cpuprofile=<file>`: Write CPU profile to `file`
- `-memprofile=<file>`: Write memory profile to `file`

These flags are useful for performance debugging and analysis.

### Debugging and Logs

View logs and error messages in the log view by pressing `4`. This can help diagnose issues with server connections, playback, or other functionalities.
